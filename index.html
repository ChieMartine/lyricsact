[Intro]
<br>
Ah!
<br><br>
[Refrain]
<br>
Ooh-ooh, ooh (Yeah)<br>
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
<br><br>
[Verse 1]
<br>
It's hard to make yourself believe<br>
That it'll get better when you feel defeated<br>
And carrying on is easier said than done<br>
It took a while to see that I was in need<br>
Of help from somebody else but she keeps<br>
Reminding me that I'm not the only one
<br><br>
[Pre-Chorus]
<br>
And babe, I woulda told you this was gonna happen<br>
If I had known that it would<br>
But now there's less time and more things that I need to say<br>
And I'm afraid
<br><br>
[Chorus]
<br>
That there will always be a part of me that's holding on<br>
And still believes that everything is fine<br>
And that I'm living a normal life<br>
But until somebody sits me down<br>
And tells me that I'm different now<br>
I'll always be the way I always am<br>
Oh, oh
<br><br>
[Refrain]
<br>
Ooh-ooh, ooh (Yeah)<br>
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
<br><br>
[Verse 2]
<br>
My apologies, it's such a shame<br>
I never planned to feel this way<br>
But the more that I try, the more I'm seeing a difference<br>
I'm not gonna lie
<br><br>
[Pre-Chorus]
<br>
And now I get to sit down<br>
And I'm happy to admit now, I'm on my way<br>
It seems I'm not invincible<br>
But I'm bored of the pain and I need to explain
<br><br>
[Chorus]
<br>
Yeah, there will always be a part of me that's holding on<br>
And still believes that everything is fine<br>
And that I'm living a normal life<br>
But until somebody sits me down<br>
And tells me why I'm different now<br>
I'll always be the way I always am<br>
Yeah, yeah
<br><br>
[Outro]
<br>
I, I
<br>
Woo
